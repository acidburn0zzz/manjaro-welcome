            <h2 class="content-subheader">Handling hardware</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Manjaro not only supports the use of multiple kernels (selectable from the boot screen), but allows easy access to the very latest bleeding edge kernels as well. This is undertaken through use of Manjaro's own MHWD-kernel (Manjaro Hard-Ware Detection) command.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">MHWD-kernel will automatically update a newly installed kernel with any modules currently used in your existing kernel. For example, if you were to update from kernel 3.4 to 3.10, mhwd-kernel would automatically update 3.10 with any and all modules present in 3.4. How about that!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">MHWD itself will handle your hardware with a simple cli-application. With it you can install for example graphical drivers, free and propritary.</p>
            <h2 class="content-subheader">Getting help</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Although Manjaro is designed to work as much "out of the box" as possible, it's no-where near perfect. There will be times when things go wrong, you might have questions and a desire to learn more or just want to personalise it to suit your tastes. This page provides details of some available resources to help you!</p>
            <h3 class="subparagraph">Search the web</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Perhaps the first place to look for generic Linux help is by using your favourite search engine. Just include words like Linux or Arch in your search query.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As Manjaro is based on Archlinux<a href="#footnote_1" class="success-link"><sup>1</sup></a> why not head on over to the official Arch site?</p>
            <h3 class="subparagraph">Look in the forums</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">For specific help with Manjaro we have a dedicated online forum where you can search for topics, or create one yourself! This is probably the next best place to go for collaboration, discussion and assistance. Ask for help, post your thoughts, or outline some suggestions. Don't be shy!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Manjaro currently comes with the option of two desktops, both of which have their own sub-forum too. Depending on your version, visit either that for XFCE or Openbox.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">With Manjaro Community Editions you can choose other desktops, such as Gnome, Cinnamon, Mate, E17 or KDE. They have also support forums and helpers to get you started.</p>
            <h3 class="subparagraph">Join us on IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Another option is to join us on IRC by joining our #manjaro channel on the chat.freenode.net servers.
            <h3 class="subparagraph">Sign up to a mailing list</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Another way to get help is to email questions to a Manjaro mailing list (you can also search the history for past discussions). Simply sign up to the list you prefer and follow the instructions. There is a list dedicated to several topics, just take a look!</p>
